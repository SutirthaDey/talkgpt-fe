1. Suppose, I have 3 pages with same structure. They share a navbar, footer and a FAQ. So In this case we can use Layout, keep the common part in a layout and just
change the dynamic portion using <Outlet><Outlet/>. 

So Suppose In Layout, this will be there

<Header>
<Outlet>
<Footer>

Now in the router, we need to define the routes for the 3 pages where this will be like

{
  path: "/chat",
  element: <ChatLayout />,
  children: [
    { path: "", element: <Home /> },
    { path: "profile", element: <Profile /> },
  ],
}


In case, if any page is completely separate or doesn't share any common layout, we keep the page in the element itself.
